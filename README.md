We believe in the power of artificial intelligence! You should know that all features in the Pday protocol will be managed by AI at some point. This approach is an excellent option for optimizing challenging and hard-to-control tasks, especially in the creation, management, and reporting of strategies.

For the essential trading model, considered to be OTC, a much more advanced protocol is being prepared. You can open offers reinforced with limit orders, create one-to-one offers, or diversify long-term investment strategies.

More is yet to come as the development process continues, and our documents will be updated frequently.
