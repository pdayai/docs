# ðŸŽ´ Overview

Revolutionizing trading with a powerful OTC module, DCA set, and an AI-powered strategy portal on Pulsechain.

Pday aims to consolidate a total of 4 separate modules into a single platform, initially three and subsequently one, making them available to the entire Pulsechain community.

* **Advanced OTC Portal**
* **Customizable DCA Module**
* **AI Powered Strategy Portal**
* **Limit Order Aggregation Protocol**

We believe in the power of artificial intelligence! You should know that all features in the Pday protocol will be managed by AI at some point. This approach is an excellent option for optimizing challenging and hard-to-control tasks, especially in the creation, management, and reporting of strategies.

For the essential trading model, considered to be OTC, a much more advanced protocol is being prepared. You can open offers reinforced with limit orders, create one-to-one offers, or diversify long-term investment strategies.

More is yet to come as the development process continues, and our documents will be updated frequently.
