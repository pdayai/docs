# Hydra FX

HydraX, named after the multi-headed creature in Greek mythology, forms the cornerstone of the Pday protocol. It serves as a synaptic task executor during the phase of transferring all core products to the major product, Openbook.



The liquidity pools that HydraX will manage and place include:

* [x] Reading and routing of liquidity sources from Pulsechain through Piteas
* [x] Processing of orders in the limit order protocol
* [x] Processing of all public and private orders in DCA strategies
* [x] Processing of extendable orders for PMM and market makers

Designed to harmonize and optimize multiple data types, HydraX places data inputs in accordance with the request standard created for Openbook. Access to all types is necessary in the Openbook model aimed at enabling integration with both limit and DCA orders through the instant swap model, and the architecture created will serve this purpose.
