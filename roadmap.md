# 🛣️ Roadmap ❇️

Pday is a major protocol that brings together multiple complex models. Development began in January 2024 and is currently ongoing.

We have tried to define different stages for both the major product, Openbook Protocol, and the core products. However, it should be noted that the development process often varies, and as a result, the stages outlined here may be updated.
