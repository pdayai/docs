# ðŸ”† About Collective

Pday, the second revolutionary product of the Piteas team, is a derivative of Piteas itself. Piteas quickly achieved remarkable milestones for Pulsechain, becoming the protocol with the highest transactions/volume on the chain. Over time, the team gained significant experience with Pulsechain, identified needs within the ecosystem, and implemented them in the new project.

Having close relationships with all protocols in the ecosystem, the Piteas team fully supports Pday. In this context, all partners will receive information during the Pday development process, and quick solutions will be provided for integration requests post-release.

The community's voice is crucial! A public opinion poll was conducted, and with overwhelmingly positive feedback from the Pulsechain community, Pday came to life. In addition to its initial features, Pday will be further enriched with new features and modules, particularly in areas where artificial intelligence technology can be applied.

The Piteas team has proven itself and will strengthen this reputation further with Pday. Comprising developers, the Piteas team will continue to build the necessary products for the ecosystem, doing what it does best!
