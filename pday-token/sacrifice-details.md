#### Objective:

The Sacrifice Round is designed to demonstrate your commitment to the Pday protocol and its core principles. It is NOT an investment opportunity, and no expectation of profit should be associated with your participation. By making a sacrifice, you are making a **political statement** about the importance of decentralized finance.

#### Duration and Multiplier Rate:

Sacrifice round will last for a total of 31 days, starting from **Mar 01, 15:00 UTC**, until **Apr 01, 15:00 UTC**. Each day, the Multiplier Rate will decrease gradually as follows:

#### **Leaderboard Bonus Program üéÅ**

After the completion of the Sacrifice phase, a bonus reward will be provided to the top 10 wallets listed on the leaderboard, in addition to their multiplier rate. The bonus percentages for the top-ranked wallets are as follows:

* The 1st ranked wallet will receive an additional 10% bonus.
* Wallets ranked 2nd to 5th will receive an additional 8% bonus.
* Wallets ranked 5th to 10th will receive an additional 5% bonus.\


#### Wallet Restrictions

It is important to make the sacrifice from a wallet where you have complete control of your private keys. Contributions made from centralized exchanges or wallets where you do not have direct access to your private keys will not be accepted.

#### Points Calculation

Sacrifice Points will be calculated based on the USD value at the time of the transaction. The points table will be updated frequently on Sacrifice Portal, reflecting the current status of each participant.

#### Final Stage

After the completion of the Pday Sacrifice Round, there will be a one-week break to consolidate the contributions. A portion of the assets will be allocated to provide liquidity for the token's swap operations across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEX) protocols. Additionally, a portion of the assets will be held in the treasury for potential future listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges.
