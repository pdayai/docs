Here are some details about token allocations ðŸ‘‡

* **Protocol Treasury**: Allocated for Pday' future plans and is decided not to be used without community approval. It can be used in later stages with community approval for purposes like expanding to different networks, sourcing liquidity, or similar processes.
* **Airdrop**: Allocated for individuals who contributed during the sacrifice process and distributed fairly. A small portion is reserved for potential airdrops to incentivize protocol usage in the future.
* **Liquidity Reserve**: Approximately 50-75% provided as liquidity during the token launch phase. The remaining assets are held in reserve for future liquidity provision stages.
* **Incentives and Rewards**: Used for rewarding liquidity providers and stakers, supporting protocol partnerships, funding developments that help grow the ecosystem, grants, and other related purposes.
* **Team & Contributors**: Allocated for developers and salaried individuals who support the protocol's development.
* **Development & Marketing**: Allocated to cover expenses related to marketing Pday and to support the majority of technological developments and expenses of the protocol.
* **Piteas Loyalty Airdrop:** These tokens will be used for a customized reward system for participants of Piteas's sacrifice and PTS holders.
* **Grants & Bounty**: Allocated for third-party applications and personal initiatives related to protocol security, development, and marketing.

_It is essential to transfer unused, idle, or tokens that have been deemed unnecessary for planning changes to the treasury._
