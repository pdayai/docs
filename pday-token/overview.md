# ðŸ’  Overview

Pday is a project that generates revenue and has its own economic model. To strengthen the protocol, empower the community in decision-making, and manage the economy generated from the revenue, it will have a utility token that serves as governance and utility tool.

The PDAY Token, which will serve as the governance and utility token for Pday, is designed to have limited supply and be resistant to manipulations.
