# üêá Token Utility

The Pday Token serves as both the governance and utility token of the Pday protocol. Due to the protocol architecture, PDAY holds significant importance, especially at the core of the revenue model.

While initially resembling a share, the PDAY token's authority will expand alongside its utility areas, nourished by ecosystem revenues.

#### What are the token utilities?

* **Buyback Progress:** Revenue generated by the protocol will be used for periodic buybacks from the market. The purchased tokens can be boosted for staking pool or used for the benefit of protocol users or the community.
* **Liquidity Provide:** Liquidity assets are of great importance for a token's strength, which is why we will use protocol revenue to provide liquidity and keep liquidity assets strong.
* **Single Side Staking:** Token holders can lock their assets to earn passive income. The rewards will initially be supported by the protocol treasury and will also have a claim on the staking rewards from the protocol's revenue. _(coming soon)_
* **Swap Fee Reduction:** The fee charged by the protocol for txs will be dynamic based on the proportion of the token you stake. For Openbook/OTC/DCA/Limit order products. _(coming soon)_
