# â˜‘ DCA Modules

The Customizable DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) Module enables users to automate their investment strategies and accumulate assets over time with disciplined periodic purchases.

Our DCA Module allows users to set up recurring purchases of cryptocurrencies at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. Users can customize their DCA strategy by specifying the asset, frequency, and amount of each purchase. This approach helps investors reduce the impact of market volatility and benefit from long-term asset accumulation.

With our intuitive interface and flexible options, users can easily manage their DCA strategies and monitor their portfolio performance.
