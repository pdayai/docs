# â˜‘ Limit Order Aggregation

New Limit Order Model: Offering an Alternative Approach with Pday

Unlike traditional limit order protocols, Pday introduces an alternative & unique approach to the Pulsechain community.

Similar to the familiar limit order execution with aggregator seen in CowSwap, Pday provides users with both limit order options and the ability to execute them via aggregator protocols. At this stage, Pday will directly integrate with Piteas APIs to offer its services. Additionally, it will be compatible with other AMM or aggregator protocols beyond Piteas.

Orders placed by users are regularly queried on-chain and off-chain at specific intervals. Once conditions are met, the swap process is completed, and assets are sent to the user.

Currently, detailed research and development are ongoing for this model.
